# Gravitational Double Pendulum Visualization

## Description
This project involves the visualization of a double pendulum system using Python, Matplotlib, OOP, NumPy, and SciPy. It was adapted from an open-source double pendulum visualization project for individual physics research, aiming to demonstrate the system's behavior via numerical simulation.

## Key Features
- Adapted an open-source double pendulum visualization project for individual physics research.
- Modified the codebase to improve numerical integration techniques and visual parameters for tailored research needs.
- Integrated Matplotlibâ€™s animation module for visualization, enabling thorough analysis of pendulum behavior and trajectory evolution.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Matplotlib
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- NumPy
- SciPy

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ledaniel0/DoublePendulum.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd DoublePendulum`
